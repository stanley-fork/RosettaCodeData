# Experimental!
# Grab the entire contents of the page as an array of bytes, then decode it into a string of text:
°utf₈ &fetch "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thundergnat/rc-run/refs/heads/master/rc/resources/unixdict.txt"
°/$"_\n_"   # Split the string into words by line breaks
▽⊸≡◇(≍⊸⍆)   # Keep the words that are sorted, i.e. have their letters in alphabetical order
▽⊸(=⊸/↥≡◇⧻) # Keep the remaining words that are the longest
≡◇&p        # Print out each word individually
