From [https://github.com/aspizu/goboscript/ the goboscript repo]:<br>

<q>goboscript is a text-based programming language that compiles to Scratch. Write Scratch projects in text, and compile it into a .sb3 file -- which can be opened in the Scratch editor, TurboWarp or be uploaded to the Scratch website.</q>

===Package managers===
Despite being a relatively new programming language, goboscript has multiple package managers.

* [https://github.com/aspizu/backpack backpack] - The official goboscript package manager
* [https://github.com/inflated-goboscript/inflator inflator] - A more powerful package manager inspired by Python's pip
